//Log for Project SunPass:
2/28:
Created Shapes.h with a parent class and child
classes according to the specifications of the webpage.

2/29:
Created shapes.cpp with co3330, and it compiled sucessfully.

2/30:
Makefile was created as needed for both files to create stester.x,
along with shapes.o.

2/31:
Header file for the  Vehicle class and its child classes such as Car, Truck,
Van, etc.
are created as specified with the instructions given.


3/1:
Implementation file is completed for the vehicle class and its child classes,
there was a slight bit of confusion behind the errors at first but these were
fixed on 3/3.

3/3:
Compilation flag errors were fixed, an error occurred in the vehicle
constructors in which the private variables were placed last but these were
fixed:

Correct implementation:

public:
//Public methods/variables placed here

private:
//Private methods/variables placed herle

protected:
//Protected methods/variables placed here:

Since these were not in the correct order, compilation did not occur.

3/4:
A minor issue was fixed where the parameter values would not show on
both stester.x and vtester.x, this was fixed by placeing the variable values
within the child and parent constructors in an if statement.
For example:

*/
Vehicle::Vehicle(a1_, a2_, aN_): Shape(a1, a2, aN)
{
  std::cout <<  "Vehicle(" << Shape::a1_ << ... "n\";
}//Vehicle:
